Polyfill Mod for Minetest

bhpolyfill "Blockhead's polyfill" mod for Minetest. The intent is to add certain
API functions that are part of Minetest, and that can be done in pure Lua, into
older versions of the engine than they were written for.

Currently this is only vector.combine out of the vector library, but more may
follow.
